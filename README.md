## Holiday-Spotter
The Python project uses APIs that provide information about holidays. It prompts the user to input a specific date and then queries the API  to determine if that date corresponds to a holiday. The code retrieves the holiday information and compares it with the user input. If there is a match, the code displays a message indicating that the date is a holiday. Otherwise, it informs the user that the date is not recognized as a holiday.

By utilizing this Python code with the appropriate holiday API or data source, users can easily verify if a particular day is designated as a holiday, allowing them to plan their activities accordingly.
